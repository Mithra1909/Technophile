#Bus monitoring and tracking system for college transportation

Universities and other activity centres have always been concerned about bus monitoring and tracking. With rising enrollments, monitoring buses has become a major concern for educational institutions. Mobile phones are frequently used and increasing in popularity. The installation of an electronic gadget in a bus, along with an Android App put on any SMART phone, allows the user to track the bus's whereabouts. This project is implemented as an android application and is based on IoT. This method is a real-time system because it automatically sends GPS system information to the system/smartphone. GPS (Global Position Satellite) navigation systems are included in the proposed proposal. GPS is used to track the bus's whereabouts. Using the Wi-Fi module, the captured data is transferred to a remote server. Buses are equipped with GPS systems that allow them to track their location. The server keeps track of the position and saves the information in a database.
The Arduino UNO is utilised as a working platform. GPS will send the bus's current location to the server on a regular basis. The client application displays a map of the bus's whereabouts. It employs the RTC (Remote Time Clock) to provide students and staff with updated information at various time intervals and shows where the bus is on the map.
